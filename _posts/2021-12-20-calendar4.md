Trenger du et avbrekk fra eksamenslesing? Helt Sikker vil de fire søndagene før jul publisere en liten CTF-oppgave. Alle som løser oppgaven er hver uke med i trekningen av et foodora-gavekort! Det blir en ekstra trekning på slutten blant de som løser alle fire :)

Her er fjerde luke:

### Package Excange

Everyone loves christmas games, and this year is no exception. We are going to be swapping presents... A lot. But you saw one present that seemed **way** more interesting than the rest.
Can you make out a way to ensure that this specific present lands in your hands by the end of the game?

Hints:

- This time you have to see, but not sharp.
- Whats the problem with pseudo-random number generators?
- If you have the program and you have control of the execution, you can skip the fluff and go straight to whats interesting.
- Is the game rigged??
- There are similarities between this and the challenge from the second week. 

You present can be found here: [package_exchange.zip](/public/package_exchange.zip)

Please submit your answer [here.](https://forms.gle/ufVCcPBDw21Gi5M38)
