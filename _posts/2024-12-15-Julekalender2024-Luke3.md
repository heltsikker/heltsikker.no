We found the access point to the database that stores everyone's gifts, but it is password protected. We intercepted some messages being sent across their WiFi and we think there may be a hint to the password hidden in the messages, can you decipher them. Their WiFi setup is really old what a cheapskate. I think the first message is the flag we are looking for. The flag looks like this HSCTF{xxxxx_xxxxxxxxx}.
