                The North Pole is in a state of crisis! The previously intercepted message revealed a dire situation - Santa's workshop has fallen victim to a ransomware attack, 
                putting Christmas in jeopardy. The Christmas Intelligence Agency (CIA) has swiftly dispatched its elite Incident Response team to assist Santa in decrypting the ransomed files. 
                Your mission, as part of the response team, is to analyze the encrypted data, recover the encrypted giftlists ensuring that the right gifts reach the deserving children on Christmas morning.

                Although the Christmas Intelligence Agency (CIA) have reversed the ransomware and decrypted all the files, they were able to look through some logs and found something suspicious in the network logs. 
                Due to the dire situations the CIA recently have faced, they are asking you to take charge in this investigation. It is in everybodys interest to find the culprit(s) behind the past incidents.

                There was indeed something fishy with the network log, and the Christmas Intelligence Agency(CIA) further tracked the intruder. To our surprise it was one of our security consultants Fjos N. Isse. 
                We found his manifesto on twitter with the handle @Fjos463275, but no signs of where he ran off to. We are looking into if he has any other social media accounts. 
                Can you find him for us? We need to know which city he ran to.
