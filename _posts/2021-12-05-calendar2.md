Her er anden luke:

### Unwrapping madness

The first present came early this year! I don't think we've seen a package quite like this one before. Whoever wrapped it did a fantastic job. The only question that remains is... How are we going to get through all the wrapping?
Hmm... Only one way to find out.

Attached you will find the aforementioned present, see if you can open it in time!

Hints:

* If you are sharp, you might be able to figure out which language was used for the program.
* If you spy even sharper, you might find it useful that its possible to recover a lot of symbols from programs written like this one.

You present can be found here: [unwrapping_madness.zip](/public/unwrapping_madness.zip)

Please submit your answer [here.](https://forms.gle/avrm4PcVGzkWSiYh6)
