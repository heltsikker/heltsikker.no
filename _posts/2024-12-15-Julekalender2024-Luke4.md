Now that we finally gained access, we can start our mayhem. Let's change gifts in the db, so that everyone gets coal!
The access point to the db is a simple interface that lets us query a name and in return get the gift for that name. If it only had more functionality. I guess they don't want anyone modifying the database entries.

Have both files in same dir, and launch by running: java -jar SantasDB-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
