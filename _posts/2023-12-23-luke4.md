There was indeed something fishy with the network log, and the Christmas Intelligence Agency(CIA) further tracked the intruder. To our surprise it was one of our security consultants Fjos N. Isse. We found his manifesto on twitter with the handle @Fjos463275, but no signs of where he ran off to. We are looking into if he has any other social media accounts. 
Can you find him for us? We need to know which city he ran to.

send in the answer as HSCTF{cityname}, merry christmas.
